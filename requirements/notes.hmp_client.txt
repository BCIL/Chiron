Users will still access the iHMP site (http://portal.ihmpdcc.org/) through the web, but there is now initial support for generation of a MANIFEST file, which can be used on the command line to download data selections.  Developers are currently working on a method of referencing a manifest ID the client can use so that even an actual MANIFEST file isn't needed.

From James:
The client is still in its infancy but I don't expect the dependencies to expand all that much from what's noted in the README in the repository: 

https://github.com/jmatsumura/hmp_client

Point 3 in the README has an example command. If running within your Docker container you can trim all the Docker run prefixes like: 

python client.py -url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmatsumura/hmp_client/master/test/hmp_cart_4e4fdaf58.tsv -destination /path/to/put/files

----------
Currently users will access their resource through the web only, so nothing is needed at all within the Docker image.  This could potentially change later, as they are working on a system which allows users to generate a MANIFEST for data, which could then be used on the command line for their client (not yet completed) to actually download their data.  If that becomes functional, we would only need to include their client in the image.
