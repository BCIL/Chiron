# HMP Data Exercise
This document walks you through the steps of extracting data from the HMP Cloud Archive and completing the following analysis tasks.

* Compare 16S and WGS community profiles for a body site
* Compare the 16S community profiles for two different body sites


## Compare 16S and WGS community profiles for a body site

The comparison of the 16S and corresponding WGS data is completed using the community profiles generated by Qiime and MetaPhlAn2 at the genus level. In this exercise you will download the precomputed community profiles, generate a list of a subset of samples for a particular body site and visit where we have both 16S and WGS data, and then extract the community profiles for this subset of samples. Once you have these subset profiles you will import them into Metaviz to compare the profiles graphically.


### Download Qiime and MetPhlAn Community Profiles
In the data_exercise directory you will find a GDC manifest file which has the information that the GDC Client needs to download the precomputed community profiles. Copy the manifest file to the local working directory and run the following command to download the profiles:

```
gdc_client hmp_data_exercise.manifest
```

This should download the following files:

    hmp1-II_metaphlan2-mtd-qcd.pcl.txt

    v35_psn_otu.genus.fixed.txt

### Create a list of samples where we have 16S and WGS data
In the data_exercise directory you will find the files that have the metadata associated with 16S and WGS data. Copy the two files (16s_metadata.tsv, wgs_metadata.tsv) to the local working directory.

The HMP samples were collected from the following body sites:
```
Anterior_nares
Buccal_mucosa
Hard_palate
Keratinized_gingiva
L_Retroauricular_crease
Mid_vagina
Palatine_Tonsils
Posterior_fornix
R_Antecubital_fossa
R_Retroauricular_crease
STSite
Saliva
Stool
Subgingival_plaque
Supragingival_plaque
Throat
Tongue_dorsum
Vaginal_introitus
```
However, for this exercise we will use samples from the first visit for the following three body sites: "Anterior_nares", "Stool", and "Posterior_fornix".

#### Create a list of samples that will be used for the exercise.
Use the script generate_matched_visit_samples.R to create a list of randomized samples from a particular body site and visit. The usage of the script is described below.

```
Usage:
generate_matched_visit_samples.R
    -[m16s|s] <16S metadata file>
    -[wgs|w] <16S metadata file>
    -[bodysite|b] <bodysite>
    -[visit|v] <visit number>
    -[count|c] <rand subject count>
    -[help|h]

```
The following command will extract matched samples for 25 randomly selected subjects from the Stool samples. The output is written to the file bodysite_rand_samples.txt

```
Rscript generate_matched_visit_samples.R --wgs wgs_metadata.tsv --m16s 16s_metadata.tsv --count 25 --visit 1 --bodysite Stool
```

#### Create a list of samples that will be used for the exercise.
Use the script extract_subset.R to take the list of samples identified in the previous step and the community profiles generated by Qiime and MetaPhlAn2 and extract out the profiles for these matched samples.

```
Usage:
extract_subset.R
    -[qiime|q] <Qiime OTU table>
    -[metaphlan|m] <MetaPhlAn2 Abundance Table>
    -[samples|s] <Samples file from previous step>
    -[help|h]
```

The following command will generate the abundance matrices for the specified subset of samples.
```
Rscript extract_subset.R --qiime v35_psn_otu.genus.fixed.txt --sample Stool_rand_samples.txt --metaphlan hmp1-II_metaphlan2-mtd-qcd.pcl.txt
```
